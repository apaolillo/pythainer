 4. Properties (`@property`)
 5. Static methods (`@staticmethod`) 
 6. Class methods (`@classmethod`) 
 7. Normal methods 
 8. Protected or private methods (with the name starting with `_`)


## Check list to modify a python file

- if the file is executable, the shebang must be the first line: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- type hinting is correct & complete (to a _reasonable_ extent)
- sorting imports: `isort --profile black .`
- formatting: `black -l 100 .`
- checking: `pylint`
- checking: `flake8`
