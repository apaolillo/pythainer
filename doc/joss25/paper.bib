  abstract     = {The automatic translation of legacy C code to Rust presents significant challenges, particularly in handling preprocessor macros.   C macros introduce metaprogramming constructs that operate at the text level, outside of C's syntax tree, making their direct translation to Rust non-trivial.   Existing transpilers --- source-to-source compilers --- expand macros before translation, sacrificing their abstraction and reducing code maintainability.   In this work, we introduce Oxidize, a macro-aware C-to-Rust transpilation framework that preserves macro semantics by translating C macros into Rust-compatible constructs while selectively expanding only those that interfere with Rust's stricter semantics.  We evaluate our techniques on a small-scale study of real-world macros and find that the majority can be safely and idiomatically transpiled without full expansion.},

Primary safety issues are the inability to enforce reliable specification of component dependencies, and the lack of support for multiple versions or variants of a component. This renders deployment operations such as upgrading or deleting components dangerous and unpredictable. A deployment system must also be flexible (i.e., policy-free) enough to support both centralised and local package management, and to allow a variety of mechanisms for transferring components. In this paper we present Nix, a deployment system that addresses these issues through a simple technique of using cryptographic hashes to compute unique paths for component instances.},
